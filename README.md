## 📸 Dashboard Preview

![Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard.png)

A full-stack web application that helps students stay consistent with daily goals by tracking completion and maintaining streaks.

Users can create goals like solving DSA problems, studying, or going to the gym, and the system tracks their daily progress and calculates streaks automatically.

---

# 🚀 Features

• Create and manage daily goals
• Track streaks based on consecutive completions
• Mark goals as completed for the day
• Handle missed days with optional reason tracking
• View streak history calendar
• Dashboard showing today's goals and progress

---

# 🧠 How Streak Calculation Works

Instead of storing streak numbers directly, the system calculates streaks using completion history.

Example:

| Date  | Status    |
| ----- | --------- |
| Mar 1 | Completed |
| Mar 2 | Completed |
| Mar 3 | Completed |
| Mar 4 | Missed    |

Current streak = **0**
Longest streak = **3**

This approach avoids incorrect streak counts and keeps the data consistent.
